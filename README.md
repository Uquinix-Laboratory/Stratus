What is Stratus?
================

Stratus is a modern operating system with the objective of simplicity and performance.

Stratus is based on the original code of [BRUTAL](https://github.com/brutal-org/brutal); building on top of it with enhanced drivers, secured code, and a graphical user interface - all whilst remaining fully open source and keeping the initial values of the project intact.
